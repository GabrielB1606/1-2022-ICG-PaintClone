Compile with CMake (at least version 3.0.0).

## Basics
Select a shape and drag the mouse just like paint.
Use the **center mode** to set the first click as the center of the figure, or use the vertice mode to set each vertex of the figure with a click.
You can also select things with the **selection mode** and change it's properties.
